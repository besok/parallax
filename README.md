# Digital Factory Laboratory (DiFiLab)

This project is a framework for building Industrial Digital factory layout
and performing Virtual Commissioning of complex manufacturing and logistics systems. 

Developed in Rust, it aims to provide a high-performance, reliable, and concurrent
platform for simulating factory layouts, equipment behavior, and control system logic.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to create a tool that allows engineers and developers in industrial automation to:

- Model their physical factory layout, including robotic cells, machinery, AGV routes, sensors, and other critical
  components.
- Simulate the dynamic behavior of this equipment and the interactions between different systems (MES, FES, Transit,
  Hardware).
- Validate software changes (e.g., in MES, FES, or transit control logic) in a safe, virtual environment before
  deployment to the physical factory floor.
- Reduce Risk and Downtime associated with software updates and system changes by identifying potential issues and
  bottlenecks offline.
- Potentially Connect to Real Hardware (like PLCs) in the future for more accurate simulation and testing scenarios.

## Core Modules

- [Simulation Engine](kernel/README.md): Manages the simulation timeline, state updates, and event handling.
- Factory Layout Modeling: Defines the physical arrangement of equipment and infrastructure.
- Equipment Models: Provides detailed, configurable models for various types of machinery and vehicles.
- Communication Interfaces: Handles interaction with external systems using standard industrial protocols.
- Data Visualization: Offers a visual representation of the simulation state and factory layout.
- Testing and Validation Framework: Tools for defining and running test scenarios and analyzing results.
- Data Management: Handles configuration, input, and output data for simulations.
