## A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world physical system or process.

**Parallax fits this description perfectly because
it aims to create a dynamic, data-driven software model of your entire factory shop floor.**

## How Parallax Fits the "Digital Twin" Concept

- It's a Virtual Model of a Physical System: It is modeling the factory's physical components (conveyors, robotic cells,
  AGVs) and their spatial relationships.

- It Simulates Processes: The model isn't static; it simulates the real-world processes of manufacturing, material
  transport, and data communication.

- It's Data-Driven: The twin is animated and driven by the same data and events (production orders, task commands) that
  the real factory would use.

The key distinction for the project is its purpose.
It is building a digital twin specifically for simulation, testing, and development, rather
than for real-time operational monitoring of a live factory.

**Calling it a "Digital Twin for Testing" is a strong and accurate way to describe the project.**
