### Simulation Engine.Core Capabilities
#### Discrete Event Simulation (DES): Essential for modeling the overall process flow.
Events like "AGV Arrives," "Robot Finishes Task," "Part Enters Cell," "MES Sends an Order" trigger state changes and subsequent actions.
This is fundamental for testing the logic of your MES <-> FES layer and understanding system throughput, bottlenecks, and resource utilization.
